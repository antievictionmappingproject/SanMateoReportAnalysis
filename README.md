# Analysis of San Mateo eviction case dataset

This repository contains R analysis scripts and results for the San Mateo eviction dataset. The main dataset is in `data/san mateo eviction data.csv`. Note that all R scripts should be run from the top level directory to work.

# Results

- `outputs/frequency_summaries/` contains frequency and percentage summaries for various columns in the dataset where this sort of analysis makes sense.
- `outputs/` currently contains a summary table comparing the total population simplified race demographics to the percentages of eviction cases by race.
- `figs/` contains figures visualizing some of the results of the analysis so far (all made by running `R/analysis_and_figures.R`).

# Requirements to run

- R version >=3, gdata package
